This script converts `.emlx` and `.partial.emlx` files written by Apple‚Äôs
[Mail.app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(Apple)) into fully self-contained, ‚Äústand alone‚Äù `.eml` files which can
be imported and opened by a great variety of email applications (Mail.app, Thunderbird, ‚Ä¶).

Apple uses these formats for internal storage (see `~/Library/Mail/Vx`), and under normal circumstances you will not
come in contact with those files. Unfortunately, one of my IMAP mailboxes went out of service and I was not able to copy
all the messages to a different account with Mail.app, even though all mails and attachments were there (see
[here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/312942/recovering-emails-from-defunct-imap-account) for the story).

That‚Äôs why I created this script.

## Installation

<!-- ### With Homebrew

This is the easiest way if you‚Äôre not familiar with Deno. Install the script and all dependencies with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
$ brew install qqilihq/partial-emlx-converter/partial-emlx-converter
```

I would like to make this script available in the Homebrew core repository as well, but for this the project needs more
‚≠êÔ∏è and üç¥ ‚Äî please help! -->

### With Deno

Use a current version of [Deno](https://deno.com) (currently built and tested with 1.40.5) and run the following command
to build a self-contained binary `partial-emlx-converter`:

```shell
$ deno install -n partial-emlx-converter --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qqilihq/partial-emlx-converter/master/src/run.ts
```

Ensure to configure the path if being told so.

## Usage

Run the executable with at least two arguments: (1) Path to the directory which contains the `.emlx` and `.partial.emlx`
files, (2) path to the existing directory where the results should be written to.

```shell
$ ./partial-emlx-converter /path/to/input /path/to/result
```

Optionally, you can specify `--ignoreErrors` as third argument. This way, the conversion will not be aborted in case
there‚Äôs an error for a file (see the log output for details in this case).

## Build

Use a current version of [Deno](https://deno.com) (currently built and tested with 1.40.5) and run any of the following
tasks:

```shell
$ deno lint
$ deno test
$ deno format
$ deno build
```

<!-- ## Releasing

TODO - figure out how to update the [Homebrew formula]((https://github.com/qqilihq/homebrew-partial-emlx-converter)) to
make use of the binary. -->

## About the file formats

**Disclaimer:** I figured out the following by reverse engineering. I cannot give any guarantee about the correctness.
If you feel, that something should be corrected, please let me know.

`.emlx` and `.partial.emlx` are similar to `.eml`, with the following peculiarities:

### .emlx

These files start with a line which contains the length of the actual `.eml` payload:

```
2945
Return-Path: <john@example.com>
X-Original-To: john@example.com
‚Ä¶
```

The number `2945` denotes, that the actual `.eml` payload is 2945 characters long, starting from the second line.

At the end, these files contain an XML [property list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list) epilogue, which
holds some Mail.app-specific meta data. Using the given character length at the file‚Äôs beginning, this epilogue can be
stripped away easily and an `.eml` file can be created.

**Edit:** Later, I found those additional sources, which basically confirm my findings:

- [Patching .emlx files](https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2008/03/03/2211)
- [emlx.py](https://gist.github.com/karlcow/5276813)
- [emlx flags?](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2005/07/emlx-flags/)
- [Documentation on Apple Mail's .emlx data structure(s) (for conversion purposes)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/884440/documentation-on-apple-mails-emlx-data-structures-for-conversion-purposes)

### .partial.emlx

Mail.app uses this format to save emails which contain attachments. Attachments are saved as separate, regular files
relative to the `.partial.emlx` file. Afaik, Apple does this due to Spotlight indexing.

Mail.app‚Äôs internal file structure looks as follows (nested into two further hierarchies of directories named with
number 0 to 9):

```
Attachments/
  1234/
    1.2/
      image001.jpg
    2/
      file.zip
  ‚Ä¶
Messages/
  1234.partial.emlx
  ‚Ä¶
```

`1234` is obviously the email‚Äôs ID. The `Attachments` directory contains the raw attachment files, whereas `Messages`
contains the messages stripped of their attachments (and `.emlx` files, for messages which did not contain any attached
files in first place).

The subdirectories `1.2` and `2` in above‚Äôs example are numbered according to their positions within the corresponding
email‚Äôs [Multipart](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html) hierarchy.

To convert a `.partial.emlx` file into an `.eml` file, the separated attachments need to be re-integrated into the file.

## Credits

Without the following modules I would probably be still working on this script (or have given up on the way). Thank you
for saving me so much time!

Beside that, here are some resources which I found very helpful during development:

- [Test Cases for HTTP Content-Disposition header field (RFC 6266) and the Encodings defined in RFCs 2047, 2231 and 5987](http://test.greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/)

Pull requests are very welcome. Feel free to discuss bugs or new features by opening a new issue. In case you submit any
bug fixes, please provide corresponding test cases and make sure that existing tests do not break.
